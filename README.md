# Movie Industry Business Analysis Project

## Overview
This project explores key factors that contribute to a movie's financial success, leveraging data from multiple sources to provide actionable insights for industry stakeholders. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data-driven recommendations, we aim to optimize decision-making for film studios, producers, and investors.


## 2.0 Business Understanding
### Problem Statement
Our company now sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. We are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. Then translate the findings into actionable insights that the head of our company's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Project Objectives
### Key Business Questions:
- Using SQL for data extraction, Python for data analysis and visualization, and statistical techniques for trend analysis, we aim to:
1. Identify the most profitable film genres to prioritize.
2. Analyze the impact of budget on revenue and suggest optimal budget allocation.
3. Assess how critical and audience ratings affect box office success.
4. Determine seasonal trends to optimize movie release timing.
5. Examine Domestic and international market trends for domestic and global distribution strategies.

This analysis will help the company's leadership make informed, data-driven decisions on film production investments, ensuring maximum profitability and industry competitiveness.


## Data Understanding & Analysis
To conduct this analysis, we sourced data from multiple authoritative platforms in the film industry. These sources provide comprehensive insights into box office performance, audience reception, and critical reviews.

## Data Sources & Description
* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/) - Provides detailed box office revenue data, including domestic and international earnings.
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) - Offers extensive movie metadata, including genre, director, budget, and user ratings.
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) - Aggregates critic and audience reviews, helping assess the impact of ratings on movie success.
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) - Supplies information on movie production, popularity, and cast details.
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/) - Provides financial insights, including movie production budgets and revenue figures.

By integrating data from these sources, we ensure a holistic, data-driven approach to understanding industry trends and making informed recommendations for our new movie studio.
